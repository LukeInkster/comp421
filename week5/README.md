# Review and Discussion of research papers / applications
This week is about getting some familiarity with the range of applications possible with deep feed-forward architectures.

## Colouring in of gray-scale images
`(Tuesday: led by Scott, and ...)`
* this is an application
* Colouring in of gray-scale images - see the links for this in ["inspirational applications of deep learning"](http://machinelearningmastery.com/inspirational-applications-deep-learning/)
** [colorization](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~larsson/colorization/)


## deep reinforcement learning
`(Wednesday: led by Luke Inkster and Kelsey Jack)`
* Algorithm combines a deep net and regular policy gradient ideas, on a new application.`
* For a good place to start, read the [Karpathy summary and discussion](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/)


## Generative Adversarial Nets
`(Friday: probably led by Yi Liu and Linfeng Gu)`
* A 2014 paper by Goodfellow et al. that has already been cited 150 times
* [Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661). (perhaps [this](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/gan/) useful).
