# Assessment structure:
   * 5 for each of two presentations
   * 10 for each of three [assignments](Assignments)
   * 20 for a [project](Assignments) (and short interview on it)
   * 40 for a 2 hour exam
 
# Awesome resources
* [Colah's blog](http://colah.github.io/)
* [Karpathy's blog](http://karpathy.github.io/)

# Contribute!

__Pull requests__ Add some notes of what you lecture up here, scribbles/notes of related problems, add links to resources, ... ?

__Raise an issue.__ Ask questions, clarify course matrial, ... ?? Just treat it like a forum.

These will be the notes and resources the exams and assignments are built from. It should (hopefully) serve as good study material.

# Want more
If you want to take part in the Machine Learning and Complex Systems research group at ECS, you're very welcome to come along to weekly meetups and so on - announcements/chat on [gitter](https://gitter.im/festivalvic/Lobby).
