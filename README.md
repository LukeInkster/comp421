# Contribute!

__Pull requests__ Add some notes of what you lecture up here, scribbles/notes of related problems, add links to resources, ... ?

__Raise an issue.__ Ask questions, clarify course matrial, ... ?? Just treat it like a forum.

These will be the notes and resources the exams and assignments are built from. It should (hopefully) serve as good study material.
