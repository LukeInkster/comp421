## Assignments

### Assignment 1
Note: Some of the maths in the Assignment 1 notebook does not seem to render very well in github (e.g. vertical lines and unintended line-breaks).
But it should look okay if you pull it and run as a notebook - another advantage of doing so is that you can write  your answers into the same structure and submit that...

### Assignment 2
The [Second assignment](SecondAssignment.ipynb) is out. The due date is September the 12th, which is the "second Monday back" (but think about submitting it early for kicks, in order to move to other things?).
