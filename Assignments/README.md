## Assignments

### Assignment 1
Note: Some of the maths in the Assignment 1 notebook does not seem to render very well in github (e.g. vertical lines and unintended line-breaks).
But it should look okay if you pull it and run as a notebook - another advantage of doing so is that you can write  your answers into the same structure and submit that...
