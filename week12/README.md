# Week 12 - More Autoencoders


## Variational autoencoders, continued.
`(Tuesday: Yi and Max)`
* last week we looked at a [Tutorial on Variational Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05908)
* [slides](../week11/variational_autoencoders.pdf)
* we will continue this discussion (and get to the the main paper [Autoencoding Variational Bayes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114).

## Adversarial autoencoders
`(Wednesday: Edward and Josiah)`
* we will discuss the paper [Adversarial autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05644)

## Adversarial autoencoders, continued.
`(Friday: Alex and Linfeng)`
* Adversarial autoencoders, continued.
* This is also the last lecture  of COMP421! I will quickly talk about the exam: the titles of questions. The exam will have 7 questions, of which you can choose any 5. One of those is to discuss one out of "Autoencoding Variational Bayes" and "Adversarial Autoencoders", so that's good incentive for us to nail the ideas in the above papers.
