# Week 12 - More Autoencoders


## Variational autoencoders, continued.
`(Tuesday: Yi and Max)`
* last week we looked at a [Tutorial on Variational Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05908) (see also [slides](../week11/variational_autoencoders.pdf) from then)
* we will continue this discussion (and look at the main paper [Autoencoding Variational Bayes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114).

## Adversarial autoencoders
`(Wednesday: Edward and Josiah)`
* we will discuss the paper [Adversarial autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05644)

## Adversarial autoencoders, continued.
`(Friday: Alex and Linfeng)`
* Adversarial autoencoders, continued.

## Seeking your feedback on the Course and the Teaching
* On your main Blackboard page, you should see (top right I think) requests for feedback.
* Please (please!) do fill in these! I want to hear what you thought of the way I ran COMP421 this year, especially whether the "loose" discussion oriented stuff helped you to be interested and to learn. Plus it's a really bad look if nobody does the jolly form :)

## About the exam 
* on 10th November in KK202 (check), in the afternoon - starts 2:30pm, for two hours
* The exam will have 7 questions, of which you can choose any 5. If you answer more than five, only the best five will be counted.
* Question titles as follows:

1. Clustering and dimensionality reduction
2. Regularisation
3. Bayesian machine learning
4. Time
5. Learning from Reinforcement
6. Unsupervised learning
7. Discussion of a research article

* Question 7 asks you to discuss one of the two papers we've looked at in Weeks 11 and 12, namely Autoencoding Variational Bayes and Adversarial Autoencoders:
"Write a short essay discussing the content in one of the above.
Your discussion should both summarise  and critically evaluate the material in the article. (ie. address what is said, and what its significance is).
Note: To be critical does not necessarily mean to criticise in a negative manner.  Rather it requires you to question the information and arguments given and present your evaluation or judgement of what
the article is claiming.  To do this well, you should attempt to understand the topic from different perspectives and to put it into the context of other work, and the ideas you have learned about in the
course.
You should however mention the strengths and weaknesses of the article.  For example, you might like to say whether you find the arguments are sound, what the most significant contribution is being made to the advancement of knowledge, what evidence is presented in service of the argument, and so on.
In doing this, you are welcome to draw comparisons between the article you choose to focus on mainly and the other of the two articles above, but this is not essential."
